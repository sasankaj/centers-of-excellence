IT Infrastructure Optimization CoE is supporting the USDA with their consolidation of data centers from 39 to 2. With accelerated closure planning and data center site visits, USDA has already met their closure goal for FY18 by closing 18 data centers. The CoE and USDA will continue to accelerate closures by helping agencies develop their migration planning/project plans for the remaining data centers scheduled to close in FY19. The CoE is supporting USDA mission areas by conducting application rationalization assessments on applications impacted by closures. The IT Infrastructure Optimization CoE is working with agency stakeholders, assessing the value of these closures to USDA, and providing executive briefings on the progress USDA is making towards its modernization work.
