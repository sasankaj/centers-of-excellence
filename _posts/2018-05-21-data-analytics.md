The USDA's Office of Customer Experience has collaborated with the GSA CoE and OCIO to pilot a web and phone contact line for USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue.  The [Tell Sonny website](https://www.usda.gov/tellsonny) and contact center line give USDA's customers the opportunity to reach out and communicate directly with the USDA about the issues that matter to them most across all USDA agencies and programs.

The Data and Analytics and Contact Center CoEs developed a Tell Sonny dashboard that gives the Office of Customer Experience a daily view of the topics and trends that are of most concern for USDA customers nationwide. The dashboard includes the capability to filter by topic, agency, and the location of the commenter and we are in the process of evaluating technology such as sentiment analysis to further classify comments to make them useful for driving customer experience and service delivery performance.
