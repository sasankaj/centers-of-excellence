The [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/) (GSA) [Federal Acquisition Service](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service) (FAS) and [United States Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/) (USDA) will host an Industry Day on June 27, 2018 and Reverse Industry Days on June 28 and 29, 2018 for Phase II of the Centers of Excellence (CoE). Phase II will involve implementing recommendations generated during Phase I. Links to register and questions/answers are available on [our repository](https://github.com/GSA/coe-industry-day/). If you are unable to attend or we hit capacity, we will be livestreaming the event, see below.

At the Industry Day, the CoEs will present the number and scope of procurements, communicate the acquisition strategy, and update industry on the progress of USDA as the first CoE customer. Our goal for this event is to address questions and solicit feedback from our industry partners before we release solicitations.

GSA will also be hosting Reverse Industry Days on the 28th and 29th, consisting of one-on-one sessions with industry partners to review the capabilities they can offer to the groups they’re meeting with. GSA will subsequently advertise several orders under Alliant, the Professional Services Schedule, Schedule 70, and other GSA vehicles to address USDA’s needs.

Please review [our repository](https://github.com/GSA/coe-industry-day/) to find out what we expect from these events. Let us know if you have any questions or [comments](https://github.com/GSA/coe-industry-day/issues).
